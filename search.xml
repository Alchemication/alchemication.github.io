<h4 id="1-Motivation"><a href="#1-Motivation" class="headerlink" title="1. Motivation"></a>1. Motivation</h4><p>This idea came in to my head out of nowhere long time ago, and then I started wondering if there is any data available on this matter. It turns out that Apple allows you to export your Health data from your iPhone in an xml format (yayx!)</p>
<p>IOS keeps track of your movements, and dumps it into the local database every couple of seconds. It is stored as a timestamp and a distance walked or run.</p>
<p>But hey. How and where can we find the data about our travel activities? I will get back to this in the second part of this post, please be patient :-)</p>
<p>Here’s what we’ll do in this article:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#link21">Collect Apple Health data from an iPhone</a></li>
<li><a href="#link22">Load the Health data into Jupyter Notebook and analyse it</a></li>
<li><a href="#link23">Gather time away dates</a></li>
<li><a href="#link24">Overlay time away dates on top of the Health Data</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Sounds interesting? I know!</p>

<p>Thanks to a great <a href="http://www.idownloadblog.com/2015/06/10/how-to-export-import-health-data" target="_blank" rel="external">article</a> from 2015 by Sebastien Page - I knew that this is possible. However in the current IOS (11.x) - the method is slightly different. </p>
<p>To begin you must click on the User Icon in the top right corner (Step 1), and click on the Export Health Data link (Step 2). This will drop a zipped xml file into your mailbox. Don’t worry, it’s not huge (it was ~2.5MB for my 3 years of health data):</p>

<div class="row" style="width: 100%;">
    <div class="pull-left col-sm-3" style="float: left; width: 30%;">
        <div style="padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #EEE;">
            <img src="images/img1.jpg" alt="Step 1">
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="pull-left col-sm-3" style="float: left; width: 30%; margin-left: 20px;">
        <div style="padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #EEE;">
            <img src="images/img2.jpg" alt="Step 2">
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="clearfix" style="clear: both;">
    </div>
</div>

<p>If you don’t have an iPhone, then there is something for Android too (S-Health?), but it looks a bit complicated as of September 2017 and I won’t be covering it in this post.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong><br>You probably need to enable GPS and Location services on your iPhone for this to work.</p>

<p>Here is the Notebook:</p>

    <div class="notebook-outset">
        <iframe src="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Alchemication/preprocessed-notebooks/blob/master/apple-health-data-analysis/My%20Apple%20Health%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb" width="100%" height="600" frameborder="0"></iframe>
    </div>

<p>Now we can see the characteristics of our activities recorded on an iPhone.<br>Cool! But it’s time to take it to the next level.</p>
<p><a name="link23"></a></p>
<h5 id="2-3-Gather-time-away-dates"><a href="#2-3-Gather-time-away-dates" class="headerlink" title="2.3 Gather time away dates"></a>2.3 Gather time away dates</h5><p></p>
<p>This may seem daunting and it kind of is (as data collection often is).<br>One of the ways to achieve it, is to search for an occurance of an “Itinerary” word inside your mail client.<br>And that is exactly what I did here:</p>
<img src="/2017/09/30/apple-health-data-analysis/images/img3.jpg" alt="Gmail search" title="Gmail search">
<p>Now, with a bit of copy &amp; paste, BBC magic, manual inspection and Python reg-ex code we can turn the gmail Itinerary data into useful information.<br>Here is the Notebook:</p>

    <div class="notebook-outset">
        <iframe src="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Alchemication/preprocessed-notebooks/blob/master/apple-health-data-analysis/Trip%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb" width="100%" height="600" frameborder="0"></iframe>
    </div>

<p>At this stage, when we have both data elements collected and stored as clean csv files - let’s compare them.</p>
<p><a name="link24"></a></p>
<h5 id="2-4-Overlay-Itinerary-dates-on-top-of-the-Health-Data"><a href="#2-4-Overlay-Itinerary-dates-on-top-of-the-Health-Data" class="headerlink" title="2.4 Overlay Itinerary dates on top of the Health Data"></a>2.4 Overlay Itinerary dates on top of the Health Data</h5><p></p>
<p>This is the final Notebook in this post.<br>It will be interesting to see, if there are clear patterns in our activity over the time away.</p>

    <div class="notebook-outset">
        <iframe src="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Alchemication/preprocessed-notebooks/blob/master/apple-health-data-analysis/Trip%20Vs%20Non-Trip%20Activity%20Comparison.ipynb" width="100%" height="600" frameborder="0"></iframe>
    </div>

<h4 id="3-Conclusions"><a href="#3-Conclusions" class="headerlink" title="3. Conclusions"></a>3. Conclusions</h4><p>It turns out that the difference in the activity patterns while at home or away, is rather minor. It seems that while away, I tend to walk/run more by <strong>~500 meters</strong> a day on average.</p>
<p>One of the interesting findings, is that I am quite active while away (not only laying on the beach with a bubbly Aperol Spritz on the side).</p>
<p>If we take a look at the last plotly visualisation and zoom in on a random travel period - we can see that the y axis (kilometers) is actually quite high while being away (as indicated by the blue cross markers):</p>
<img src="/2017/09/30/apple-health-data-analysis/images/img4.jpg" alt="Trip vs Non-trip Vis" title="Trip vs Non-trip Vis">
<p>But there is definitely a catch here:<br>First: It’s not guaranteed that the Apple measurements are 100% accurate.<br>Then: some activities while at home or away are not accounted for in the dataset (basketball, gym, TRX, swimming), which could influence the final results.</p>
<p>In summary, it was an interesting excercise, where I’ve learned quite a bit about my lifestyle, but drawing black and white conclusions would be rather naive.</p>
<p>As a bonus - figuring out the super-massive API of plotly was quite a joy -;)</p>
<h4 id="What’s-next"><a href="#What’s-next" class="headerlink" title="What’s next?"></a>What’s next?</h4><p>For starters, there are more scientific approaches on comparing Time Series groups available, which I am planning to explore.</p>
<p>At this stage, buying an Apple Watch with it’s ability to record more data more often, could be an interesting idea.</p>
<p>And last but not least - every time I hop off the bike in the gym - I take a snap of the final results (time, distance and pulse).<br>Using a few Computer Vision tricks could make the Health data-set more complete.</p>
<p>I really hope, that this post was somewhat enjoyable to check out.</p>
<p>If you have any thoughts or ideas about how to improve this experiment, please leave a comment below or let me know.</p>
<p>Peace and see you next time!</p>
